> Below you will find a Jupyter Notebook that explores the Mahalanobis distance in depth.  
> It begins with the theoretical foundations and practical applications, followed by multiple Python implementations (NumPy, JAX, TensorFlow, SciPy) to ensure correctness and compare performance.  
> The notebook validates these implementations, benchmarks them across low- and high-dimensional datasets, and illustrates the geometric intuition behind the Mahalanobis distance through visualizations and whitening transformations.  
> Finally, it demonstrates the close connection to the Chi-square distribution and applies the method to a simple anomaly detection task.  
>
> The aim is to provide both a solid theoretical understanding and practical tools for applying the Mahalanobis distance in real-world scenarios.
