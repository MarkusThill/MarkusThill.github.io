This post explores the fundamentals of CUDA programming using a dual-tone multi-frequency signaling (DTMF) example. Chosen for its manageable complexity and well-defined structure, the example provides an excellent introduction to parallel computing concepts and optimization techniques.

DTMF, developed in the 1960s, is a telephone dialing system where each key is represented by the superposition of two harmonic tones. For example, pressing "5" generates frequencies of 770 Hz and 1336 Hz.

In this blog post we demonstrate how to:

- Generate DTMF dialing sequences using Python (scipy and numpy) and save them as .wav audio files.
- Design a filter bank of FIR bandpass filters, each isolating one DTMF frequency.
- Decode the dialed key sequence from the audio file through filtering and post-processing.

A CUDA/C++ implementation (dtmfCuda.cu) is included, showcasing how CUDA can accelerate the decoding process.

## Sample Files

Here are three .wav files containing DTMF signals to help you get started (you will find the files in the GitHub repository listed below). Each file encodes a sequence of telephone keypresses as audio, with each key represented by a unique combination of two frequencies.

These files are designed as an introductory example for experimenting with DTMF decoding. You can use them to test your signal processing pipeline, design and evaluate filter banks, or simply gain hands-on experience with DTMF-based signaling.

For a fun challenge, try decoding the signals using just your ears and a phone to generate reference sounds! Can you identify the dialed sequence from the characteristic dual-tone sounds? Play the files and give it a try!
