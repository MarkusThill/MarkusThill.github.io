abstract={Die Untersuchung maschineller Lernverfahren für Brettspiele stellt auch heute noch
ein sehr interessantes Forschungsgebiet dar. Dies liegt vor allem daran, dass das
Erlernen komplexer Spiele wie dem Schach- oder Go-Spiel nach wie vor als sehr
anspruchsvoll gilt.
Während Menschen in der Lage sind, gewisse Zusammenhänge bzw.
Gesetzmäßigkeiten in Spielen zu erkennen und daraus die richtigen Rückschlüsse zu
ziehen, ist dies für ein Computerprogramm deutlich schwieriger. Aus diesem Grund
müssen die Entwickler häufig viel spieltheoretisches Wissen in das Programm
einbringen, damit der Lernprozess überhaupt fähig ist, auf die besonderen
spielspezifischen Merkmale zu achten.
In dieser Arbeit wird die Anwendung von sogenannten N-Tupel-Systemen -- in
Kombination mit einer Reinforcement-Learning-Trainingsumgebung -- auf das Spiel Vier
Gewinnt untersucht. N-Tupel-Systeme dienen dazu, lineare Nutzenfunktionen von
Agenten zu approximieren, sodass Stellungsbewertungen vorgenommen werden
können. Um diese Funktionen zu erlernen, werden die N-Tupel-Systeme mithilfe des
Temporal Difference Learnings (TDL), einem Algorithmus zur Lösung von RL-
Problemen, trainiert.
Das Training der Agenten erfolgte ausschließlich durch Self-Play, während des
Trainings kam daher kein Lehrer oder spieltheoretisches Wissen irgendeiner Form zum
Einsatz. Dennoch gelang es, Agenten mit hoher Spielstärke zu trainieren, die in vielen
Fällen einen perfekten Spieler schlagen konnten. Insbesondere die N-Tupel-Systeme,
die eine sehr große Zahl an Features generieren und die passenden selektieren, tragen
zu den außerordentlich guten Ergebnissen bei.}

abstract={Machine learning tasks for board games which rely solely on self-play methods remain
rather challenging up till today. The perhaps most impressive breakthrough in this field
was achieved by Tesauro's TD-Gammon, which was able to learn the game backgammon at
expert level with a self-play variant of the temporal difference learning (TDL) algorithm.
Since then, many studies attempted to replicate some of TD-Gammon's success by applying
TDL to other board games, however, mostly with mixed results.
We found in our earlier work on the board game Connect-4 that a rich feature set is
required to successfully learn a near-perfect strategy. Nonetheless, several millions of
self-play training games were necessary in order to generate strong Connect-4 agents.
In this thesis we will mainly focus on two topics, namely online-adaptable learning rate
methods and eligibility traces, and investigate whether these approaches have the potential
to speed up learning.
For the Connect-4 learning task we show that algorithms with geometric step-size changes
have the best performance, in some cases reducing the required number of training games
to learn the game by more than 40%.
In a case study, we compare several state-of-the-art step-size adaptation algorithms with
respect to their sensitivity towards certain meta parameters.
In the further course of this thesis, we investigate the benefits of different eligibility trace
variants. Additionally, we extend several learning rate algorithms to eligibility traces and
examine their performance. We could observe that eligibility traces improve the speed of
learning by a factor of two for our Connect-4 task.
Overall, with several additional enhancements, we could reduce the number of training
games to learn Connect-4 to slightly more than 100 000, which is an improvement by a
factor of 13, compared to previously published results.
In the last sections of this work, we apply the learning framework that we developed for
Connect-4 -- with several adjustments -- to the strategic board game Dots-and-Boxes and
discuss the main problems that we observed for our initial experiments.

  abstract={In many real-world applications today, it is critical to continuously record and monitor certain machine or system health indicators to discover malfunctions or other abnormal behavior at an early stage and prevent potential harm. The demand for such reliable monitoring systems is expected to increase in the coming years. Particularly in the industrial context, in the course of ongoing digitization, it is becoming increasingly important to analyze growing volumes of data in an automated manner using state-of-the-art algorithms. In many practical applications, one has to deal with temporal data in the form of data streams or time series. The problem of detecting unusual (or anomalous) behavior in time series is commonly referred to as time series anomaly detection. Anomalies are events observed in the data that do not conform to the normal or expected behavior when viewed in their temporal context.This thesis focuses on unsupervised machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection in time series. In an unsupervised learning setup, a model attempts to learn the normal behavior in a time series — which might already be contaminated with anomalies — without any external assistance. The model can then use its learned notion of normality to detect anomalous events. }

abstract={Learning temporal patterns in time series remains a challenging task up until today. Particularly for anomaly detection in time series, it is essential to learn the underlying structure of a system’s normal behavior. Periodic or quasiperiodic signals with complex temporal patterns make the problem even more challenging: Anomalies may be a hard-to-detect deviation from the normal recurring pattern. In this paper, we present TCN-AE, a temporal convolutional network autoencoder based on dilated convolutions. Contrary to many other anomaly detection algorithms, TCN-AE is trained in an unsupervised manner. The algorithm demonstrates its efficacy on a comprehensive real-world anomaly benchmark comprising electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings of patients with cardiac arrhythmia. TCN-AE significantly outperforms several other unsupervised state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms. Moreover, we investigate the contribution of the individual enhancements and show that each new ingredient improves the overall performance on the investigated benchmark.}

We present in this paper a novel approach for anomaly detection in time series which trains unsupervised using a convolutional approach coupled to an autoencoder framework. After training, only a small amount of labeled data is needed to adjust the anomaly threshold. We show that our new approach outperforms several other state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms on a Mackey-Glass (MG) anomaly benchmark. At the same time our autoencoder is capable of learning interesting representations in latent space. Our new MG anomaly benchmark allows to create an unlimited amount of anomaly benchmark data with steerable difficulty. In this benchmark, the anomalies are well-defined, yet difficult to spot for the human eye.}

abstract={Real-world anomaly detection for time series is still a challenging task. This is especially true for periodic or quasi-periodic time series since automated approaches have to learn long-term correlations before they are able to detect anomalies. Electrocardiography (ECG) time series, a prominent real-world example of quasi-periodic signals, are investigated in this work. Anomaly detection algorithms often have the additional goal to identify anomalies in an unsupervised manner.
In this paper we present an unsupervised time series anomaly detection algorithm. It learns with recurrent Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict the normal time series behavior. The prediction error on several prediction horizons is used to build a statistical model of normal behavior. We propose new methods that are essential for a successful model-building process and for a high signal-to-noise-ratio. We apply our method to the well-known MIT-BIH ECG data set and present first results. We obtain a good recall of anomalies while having a very low false alarm rate (FPR) in a fully unsupervised procedure. We compare also with other anomaly detectors (NuPic, ADVec) from the state-of-the-art.}

    abstract={In this paper we present an unsupervised time series anomaly detection algorithm, which is based on the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) operating fully online. Given streaming data or time series, the algorithm iteratively computes the (causal and decimating) discrete wavelet transform. For individual frequency scales of the current DWT, the algorithm estimates the parameters of a multivariate Gaussian distribution. These parameters are adapted in an online fashion. Based on the multivariate Gaussian distributions, unusual patterns can then be detected across frequency scales, which in certain constellations indicate anomalous behavior. The algorithm is tested on a diverse set of 425 time series. A comparison to several other state-of-the-art online anomaly detectors shows that our algorithm can mostly produce results similar to the best algorithm on each dataset. It produces the highest average F1-score with one standard parameter setting. That is, it works more stable on high- and low-frequency-anomalies than all other algorithms. We believe that the wavelet transform is an important ingredient to achieve this.}

In this paper we present a comparative study where several online anomaly detection algorithms are compared on the large Yahoo Webscope S5 anomaly benchmark. We show that a relatively Simple Online Regression Anomaly Detector (SORAD) is quite successful compared to other anomaly detectors. We discuss the importance of several adaptive and online elements of the algorithm and their influence on the overall anomaly detection accuracy.}

  abstract={Learning board games by self-play has a long tradition in computational intelligence for games. Based on Tesauro's seminal success with TD-Gammon in 1994, many successful agents use temporal difference learning today. But in order to be successful with temporal difference learning on game tasks, often a careful selection of features and a large number of training games is necessary. Even for board games of moderate complexity like Connect-4, we found in previous work that a very rich initial feature set and several millions of game plays are required. In this work we investigate different approaches of online-adaptable learning rates like Incremental Delta Bar Delta (IDBD) or temporal coherence learning (TCL) whether they have the potential to speed up learning for such a complex task. We propose a new variant of TCL with geometric step size changes. We compare those algorithms with several other state-of-the-art learning rate adaptation algorithms and perform a case study on the sensitivity with respect to their meta parameters. We show that in this set of learning algorithms those with geometric step size changes outperform those other algorithms with constant step size changes. Algorithms with nonlinear output functions are slightly better than linear ones. Algorithms with geometric step size changes learn faster by a factor of 4 as compared to previously published results on the task Connect-4.}
