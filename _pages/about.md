Hi there! I'm Markus Thill, a Data Scientist at [Atruvia AG](https://atruvia.de/). With a background in computer engineering (B.Sc.) and Automation & IT (M.Eng.), I'm deeply passionate about the intersection of machine learning, mathematics, and programming. In my professional role, I delve into data to uncover insights and drive innovation. 

I have a particular interest in machine learning approaches, especially in the fields of time series analysis, anomaly detection, Reinforcement Learning (RL) (such as in board games), Deep Learning (DL), and incremental learning procedures.
Recently, I received my doctoral certificate from [Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en) for [my work](https://scholarlypublications.universiteitleiden.nl/handle/1887/3279161) titled "Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approaches for Multivariate Time Series Prediction and Anomaly Detection". This marked a final milestone in my academic journey, and since then, I've transitioned into the industry. During my tenure as a research associate at [TH KÃ¶ln](https://www.th-koeln.de/), I presented a total of eight peer-reviewed publications at various international research conferences.

Outside of work, I find joy in simple pleasures like flying drones and occasionally solving small mathematical riddles on projecteuler.net. Continuously learning and exploring new concepts in data science and mathematics keeps me motivated and engaged.
